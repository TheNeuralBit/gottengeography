GottenGeography is a geotagging application written for the [GNOME desktop](http://gnome.org). It stores geographical information directly into your photographs, so you never forget where your photos were taken. You do not need a GPS device in order to take advantage of GottenGeography, although it does help.

<h3>Features</h3>

* Display [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) maps.

* Draw GPS traces onto the map. Supported formats are CSV, GPX, KML, and TCX.

* Display existing photo geotags on the map.

* Manually geotag images, with no GPS device necessary, using drag & drop onto the map.

* Automatically geotag images by comparing timestamps between photos and GPS data.

* Reverse geocode using a db dump of [GeoNames.org](http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html) geolocation data. Stores city, province/state, and country names in IPTC data automatically.

* Automatically determine the timezone that your photos were taken in so that you don't have to specify it manually when you go travelling.

* Available in five languages: English, German, French, Swedish, and Spanish.
